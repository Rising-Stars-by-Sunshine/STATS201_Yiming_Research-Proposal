# STATS201_Autumn2023_Research Proposal

Title: Indicator Analysis of Global Sustainable Energy and its future trends.

This repository is for final project. I will delve in to the energy field: 
    
- Establish a energy-related dataset: Such as access to electricity, Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption, Primary energy consumption per capita, etc., varying by different countries and years.
- Explore the relations among indicators: by applying tools such as Correlation Heatmap
- Other treatmants: by causal inference
- Predict future energy consumption trend: by comparing three different prediction models (linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Regressor)

My research is meaningful for global citizens to realize current situation, and be aware of the importance of sustainable energy. It might also be useful for policy-makers and associates investors to make decisions related to sustainable energy.

This analysis is shown clearly on Github, divided into 3 parts: Method, Data, and Code. See content below:
